        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Eligibility for Returns</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We only accept returns or issue refunds in specific circumstances.
          Since food is perishable, once it is delivered and consumed, we cannot
          take it back. Returns are only eligible if:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
          <li>The order delivered is incorrect.</li>
          <li>

            standards at the time of delivery.

        <p className="mb-4">
          We do not accept returns for items that have been partially eaten,
          tampered with, or kept outside for a long time after delivery. Beverages,
          desserts, and promotional/complimentary items are also non-returnable.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Refund Conditions</h2>

          request is valid, we may:
